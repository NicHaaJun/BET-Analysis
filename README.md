# BET-Analysis

Written by: Nicolai Haaber Junge

A dashboard for performing BET analysis. The dashboard is built on a python class wrapping the pyGAPS package. With the tomocatdb package installed it is possible to commit analysed data directly to a local postgres server.

The best way of using the BET_dashboard notebook is via the excellent tool Voila.

With Voila installed simply cd to BET_dashboard and run:

voila BET_dashboard.ipynb
